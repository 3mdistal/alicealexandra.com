	Something about the landscape has resided in me to this day, even as I've shed the backwards
	ideologies of Southern Baptist cults threaded through my veins. As a closeted trans woman, I
	learned not to discard the white supremacist neo-fascism, but to empathize with the fears that
	caused it—to learn how an entire people can become so misled—in hope that art can resonate with
	the heart when so many political discussions fall on deaf ears.

	After leaving Ohio, I stayed in the Midwest, pursuing postgraduate work in Muncie, Indiana,
	getting involved in queer community, and learning how to live a life I was proud of. I then spent
	a few years living in Egypt, the UK, and France, finding out who I am when my context is taken
	away from me.

	The last few years have found me in a different space. I've always loved creating all shades of
	art, and I thrive most when I'm learning a new way to do something. Often, my brain pushes me into
	new territory before I've finished old projects, but I've learned to appreciate all the
	"incomplete" works I've made along the way. Finally, through this site, I'm sharing so many of
	them.

<p>
	Currently, I'm working in Developer Experience at Builder.io, and I’m continuing my various
	creative projects. If you're interested in building out more community around art, please send me
	your idea, and we can brainstorm together to make something extraordinary.
