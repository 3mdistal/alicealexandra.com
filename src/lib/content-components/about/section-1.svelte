	If you're a creative like me, you might understand the urge to combine all your work, to try to
	make sense of it in one central hub. That, in essence, is what *Tempo Immaterial* is about.

<p>
	This website, as you might notice, is incomplete. I lovingly call it the eternal beta. As a solo
	designer and developer who thrives taking on complex ideas, I might never iron out everything, but
	I'll <a

		rel="noreferrer"
		target="_blank">always be improving</a
	>.
</p>

<p>
	And yet, I hope you can see the site for what else it is: my best attempt to offer a little beauty
	to a world that too often looks hideous. To teach and learn all at once. To sustain myself through
	creative work while trying to make it mean something.
